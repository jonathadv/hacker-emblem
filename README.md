## About this project
Back in 2015 and 2016, the link to the Brazilian Portuguese translation of this document was broken in the original one's page. Thus this project came up with the goal of having a translation that is always being updated, reviewed and keeps its layout as similar as possible to the original document.

For more information about this translation project, please consult the [about this translation](http://jonatha.daguerre.com.br/hacker-emblem/translation.html) page (in Brazilian Portuguese).

## Disclaimer
This translation is for informational purposes only, and is not a substitute for the original document. The original version of this document, found [here](http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/), is the only definitive and official version.

This translation is made by volunteers whose the hope is to spread the knowledge to brazilian people who don't understand english.
